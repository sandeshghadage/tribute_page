              Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary 
              who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police offices in what was 
              to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely 
              symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, 
              which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household 
              name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in 
              Northern India.

              Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 
              1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but 
              eventually successful campaign for India's independence.          
              In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary 
              group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British 
              police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was 
              still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to 
              assassinate.
